#### Experience with:
* React
* Redux
* jQuery
* Firebase
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* CSS
* MySQL

I am studying a Bachelor of I.T. (Web Design & Development) at the University of Wollongong. The more I explore, the more I found myself lacking in technical skills. Therefore, I keep learning the latest technologies online to keep myself updated. I enjoy learning new technologies because my experience and confidence in web development can be boosted.
